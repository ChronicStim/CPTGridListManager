 Protocol to be applied to UICollectionViewCell objects when used with CPTGridListManager. This protocol includes 1 mandatory method which is called whenever the cell needs to be displayed. This includes the animation phases, where it allows you to redefine the NSLayoutConstraints for your cells as the animation progresses by using the transitionProgress (floatValue from 0.0 - 1.0) to interpolate between the final List and Grid layout modes. See the demo project for examples of how this is used.
